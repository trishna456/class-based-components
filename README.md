# React Class-Based Components Practice

This repository contains examples and practice code for using class-based components in React. Understanding the key concepts and differences between class-based and functional components, as well as how to manage state and use context in class-based components.

## Features

1. **Class-Based Components**:
   - **State Management**: State in class-based components is always an object named `state`.
   - **State Updates**: React merges state updates with the old state instead of overwriting it.

2. **Lifecycle Methods**:
   - Demonstrates lifecycle methods such as `componentDidMount`, `componentDidUpdate`, and `componentWillUnmount`.

3. **Context Usage**:
   - Shows how to use context with class-based components using `this.context`.

4. **Error Boundaries**:
   - Explains how to handle errors in class-based components using error boundaries since JSX cannot be wrapped with try-catch.
